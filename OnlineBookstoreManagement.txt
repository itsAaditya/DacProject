    - Functional Requirement:
        This section provides requirement overview of the system. Various functional modules that can be implemented by
        the system will be:

        Description:
        Registration if customer wants to buy the book then he/she must be registered, Unregistered user can not get to shopping cart.
        Login Customer logins to the system by entering valid user id and password for shopping.

        Report Generation after all transaction the system can generate the portable file(.pdf)
        then sent one copy to customer's Email- address and another one for the system database to calculate the monthly transaction.
        The term client/server refers primarily to an architecture or logical division of responsibilities, the client is the application (also known as the front-end), and the server is the RDBMS (also known as the back-end).
        A client/server system is a distributed system in which,Some sites are client sites and others are server sites.
        All the data resides at the server sites.
        All applications execute at the client sites.

    - Technical Issues:
        This system will work on client-Server architecture. It will require an internet server.
        The system should support some commonly used browser such as Chrome etc.
        Interface Requirement Various interfaces for the book could be:
            1. Login Page
            2. Registration form

        There will be a screen displaying information about book that the shop having.

        The customers may select the different options which will be open in another screen as
            1. Login Page
            2. Registration Form
            3. Books Page
            4. Shopping Cart
            5. Shipping Details
            6. Purchase history
            7. Account Settings
            8. Payment Gateways

     - Hardware Interface:
        The System must run over the internet,
        All the hardware shall require to connect to internet will be hardware interface for the system.
            e.g. modem,  WAN, LAN
        Specialized Server Infrastructure Hardware
        The system should use distributed servers i.e cloud for managing large amount of data so as to make it appear as single unit for end-user.
        The system should have proper clusters for backup.

     - Software Interface:
        The system is on server so it requires the any scripting language like JSP or  PHP or ASP, ETC.
        The system should be able to exchange data using XML, JASON or any advance technology.
        The system require DataBase also for the store the any transaction of the system like MySql or oracle, or SQL server etc.
        System also require DNS (Domain Name space) for the naming on the internet.
        http://www.mybookstore.in
        At the end-user need web browser for interact with the system.

    - Performance Requirement:
        There is no  performance requirement in this system, because the server request and response to client is totally based on internet connection of end-user.

    - Design Constrains:
        This system should be developed using  Standard Web Page Development Tool, which conforms GUI standards such like HTML, XML, JSON,etc.
        The system should support various RDMS and Cloud Technologies.

    - Non-Functional Requirements
        1.  Security:
            SSL
            The System use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) in all transactions that include any confidential customer information.
            The system must automatically log out all customers after a period of inactivity.
            The system should not leave any cookies on the customer's computer containing user's password.
            The system's back-end servers shall  only be accessible to authenticated administrators.
            Sensitive data will be encrypted before being sent over insecure connections like internet.
            The proper firewalls should be developed to avoid intrusions from the internal or external sources.

        2.  Reliability:
            The system provides storage of all databases on redundant computers with automatic switchover.
            The main pillar of reliability of the system  is the backup of the database
            which is continuously maintained and update to reflect the most recent changes.

        3.  Availability:
            The system should be available at all times.meaning the user can access it using web browser, only restricted by the down time of the server on which the system runs. In case of a of a hardware failure or database corruption, a replacement page will be shown.
            Uptime: It mean 24 * 7 availability
            100%
            99.9%
            99.999%
            99.9999%

        4.  Maintainability:
            A commercial database is used for maintaining the database and application server takes care of the site.
            The maintainability can be done efficiently.

        5.  Portability:
            The application is HTML and scripting language based (JavaScript). So the end user part is fully portable and any system using any web browser should be able to use the features of the system,including any hardware platform that is available
            or will be available in the future.
            An end-user  is used this system on an OS;either it is Windows or Linux.
            The System shall run on PC, Laptops and PDA.etc.
            The  technology should be transferable to different environments easily.

        6.  Accessibility:
            Only registered users should be allowed to process the orders after authentications.
            Only GUI access of the system should be permitted to end users.

        7.  Policies:
            The system should adhere to all the legal formalities of the particular countries.
            The system should maintain security related to sensitive data.

        8.  Efficiency:
            The system should provide good throughput and response to multiple users without burdening the system by using appropriate number of servers.

        9.  Safety:
            Software should not harm ethical and environmental conditions of the end users machine.

        10. Modularity:
            The system should have user friendly interface.
            It should be easily updated,modified and reused.
